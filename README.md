# Parks for Rec

## Description
Parks For Rec is an MERN full-stack application that allows the user to view all of the national parks in the US. The user can select a state, view all of national parks in that state, and see all of the activities that are available at that park. The user can also save the national parks that they have visited to keep track of how many they have been to.
